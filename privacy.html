                This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to VIew-IPTV.stream and SIdeways
                Thought LLC ("Company") and governs data collection and usage. Unless
                otherwise noted, all references to the Company include View-IPTV.site. The
                Company's application is a stream playlist viewer and information site. By
                using the application, you consent to the data practices described in this
                statement.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Collection of Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p>The Company may collect anonymous demographic information such as your:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Gender</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not collect personal information unless you voluntarily provide it. You
                may be required to provide certain information when using specific services,
                for example when registering for an account, entering a contest, signing up
                for special offers, sending an email, or submitting payment information. We
                will use your information to communicate with you regarding services or
                products you request. Additional personal or non-personal information may be
                gathered in the future.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>
            <p>The Company does not sell, rent, or lease its customer lists to third parties.</p>
            <p>
                We may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis,
                send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for
                deliveries. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal
                information except to provide these services to the Company, and they must
                maintain its confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Company may disclose your personal information, without notice, if
                required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
                necessary to comply with legal process, protect and defend the rights or
                property of the Company, or act under exigent circumstances to protect the
                personal safety of users or the public.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Right to Deletion</h2>
            <p>Upon a verifiable request from you, we will:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Delete your personal information from our records; and</li>
                <li>Direct service providers to delete your personal information from their records.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may be unable to comply with a deletion request if it is necessary to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                <li>Complete a transaction or perform a contract with you;</li>
                <li>Detect security incidents or protect against malicious activity;</li>
                <li>Debug to identify and repair errors;</li>
                <li>Exercise or ensure the right of free speech;</li>
                <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act;</li>
                <li>
                    Conduct public or peer-reviewed research in the public interest when
                    deletion would render the research impossible or seriously impair it;
                </li>
                <li>Enable solely internal uses aligned with your expectations;</li>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation; or</li>
                <li>Otherwise use the information internally in a lawful manner compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Children Under Thirteen</h2>
            <p>
                The Company does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
                from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you must ask your

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Changes to This Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The Company reserves the right to change this Policy from time to timeâ€”for
                example, when services or legal requirements change. When changes are
                significant, we will inform you, such as by emailing the address on your
                account or placing a prominent notice on our site. Your continued use of the
                application after such modifications constitutes acknowledgment and
                agreement to the modified Policy.
